    \item An online exam is attempted by 50 candidates out of which 20 are boys. The average marks obtained by boys is 12 with a variance 2. The variance of marks obtained by 30 girls is also 2. The average marks of all 50 candidates is 15. If $\mu$ is the average marks of girls and $\sigma ^2$
 is the variance of marks of 50 candidates, then 
$\mu + \sigma^2$ is equal to
