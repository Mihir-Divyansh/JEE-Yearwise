        \item Let $A_1,A_2,A_3,\dots$ be squares such that for each $n\geq1$, the length of the side of $A_n$ equals the length of diagonal of $A_{n+1}$. If the length of $A_1$ is $12$ cm, then the smallest value of $n$ for which area of $A_n$ is less than one is . \hfill{[Feb 2021]}

	\item The graphs of sine and cosine functions, intersect each other at a number of points and between two consecutive points of intersection, the two graphs enclose the same area $A$. then $A^4$ is equal to  \hfill{[Feb 2021]}
