\item If $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ are unit vectors, then the greatest value of $\sqrt{3} \abs{\vec{a} + \vec{b}} + \abs{\vec{a} - \vec{b}}$ is \hfill [Sep 2020] \\
    
\item Let $AD$ and $BC$ be two vertical poles at $A$ and $B$ respectively on a horizontal ground. If $AD = 8\text{m}$, $BC = 11\text{m}$ and $AB = 10\text{m}$; then the distance (in meters) of a point $M$ on $AB$ from the point $A$ such that $MD^2+MC^2$ is minimum is \hfill [Sep 2020]

\item Let $f : \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$ be defined as $f(x)= \begin{cases}x^5\sin\brak{\frac{1}{x}} + 5x^2,& x < 0 \\
0,& x = 0\\
x^5\cos\brak{\frac{1}{x}} + \lambda x^2,& x > 0\end{cases}$\\

The value of $\lambda$ for which $f^{\prime\prime}(0)$ exists, is \hfill [Sep 2020] \\ 

\item The angle of elevation of the top of a hill from a point on the horizontal plane passing through the foot of the hill is found to be $45^{\degree}$. After walking a distance of $80$ meters towards the top, up a slope inclined at an angle of $30^{\degree}$ to the horizontal plane, the angle of elevation of the top of the hill becomes $75^{\degree}$. Then the height of the hill (in meters) is \hfill [Sep 2020] \\

\item Set $A$ has $m$ elements and set $B$ has $n$ elements. If the total number of subsets of $A$ is $112$ more than the total number of subsets of $B$, then the value of $m\times n$ is \hfill [Sep 2020]
