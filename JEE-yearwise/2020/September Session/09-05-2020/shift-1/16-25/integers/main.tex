\item The natural number m, for which the coefficient of x in the binomial expansion of ${\left(x^m + \frac{1}{x^2}\right)}^{22}$ is 1540 , is $\cdots$ \\\hfill{[SEP 2020]}
    \item Four fair dice are thrown independently 27 times. Then the expected number of times,at least two dice show up a three or a five, is $\cdots$ \\\hfill{[SEP 2020]}
    \item Let f(x) = x. $\left[\frac{x}{2}\right]$ , for -10 $<$ x $<$ 10, where [t] denotes the greatest integer function. Then the number of points of discontinuity of f is equal to $\cdots$ \\\hfill{[SEP 2020]}
    \item The number of words, with or without meaning, that can be formed by taking 4 letters at a time from the letters of the word 'SYLLABUS' such that two letters are distinct and two letters are alike, is \\\hfill{[SEP 2020]}
    \item If the line, $2x-y+3=0$ is at a distance $\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ and $\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}$ from the lines $4x - 2y + \alpha =0$ and $6x - 3y + \beta =0$, respectively, then the sum of all possible values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is\hfill{[SEP 2020]}
