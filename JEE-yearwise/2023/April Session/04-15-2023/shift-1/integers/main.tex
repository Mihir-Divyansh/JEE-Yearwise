\item Let A = $\cbrak{ 1 , 2 , 3, 4}$ and  be a relation on the set A$\times$A defined by R=$\cbrak{\brak{a,b},\brak{c,d}:2a + 3b = 4c + 5d}$. Then the number of elements in R \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item The number of elements in the set $\cbrak{n\in N :10\leq n\leq 100 \,\,and\,\, 3^n-3 \,\,is\,\, a \,\,multiple \,\,of\,\, 7}$ is \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item Let an ellipse with centre $\brak{1,0}$ and latus rectum of length $\frac{1}{2}$ have its major axis along x-axis. If its minor axis
subtends an angle 60$\degree$ at the foci, then the square of the sum of the lengths of its minor and major axes is equal \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item If the area bounded by the curve $2y^2=3x$, lines x+y=3,y=0  and outside the circle $\brak{x-3}^2+y^{2}=2$ is A then $4\brak{\pi+4A}$ \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item Consider the triangles with vertices $\vec{A}\brak{2,1}, \vec{B}\brak{0,0}$ and $\vec{C}\brak{t, 4}$, t $\in \sbrak{0,4}$ . If the maximum and the minimum perimeters of such triangles are obtained at $t=\alpha$ and $t=\beta$ respectively . Then 6$\alpha$+2$\beta$ is equal to \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item Let the plane P contain the line 2x+y-z-3 = 0 = 5x-3y+4z+9 and be parallel to the line $\frac{x+2}{2}=\frac{3-y}{4}=\frac{z-7}{5}$Then the distance of the point $\vec{A}\brak{8,-1,-19}$ from the plane P measured parallel to the line $\frac{x}{-3}=\frac{y-5}{4}=\frac{2-z}{-12}$ is equal to  \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item If the sum of series $\brak{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}}+\brak{\frac{1}{2^2}-\frac{1}{2.3}+\frac{1}{3^2}}+\brak{\frac{1}{2^3}-\frac{1}{2^2.3}+\frac{1}{2.3^2}-\frac{1}{3^3}}+\cdots=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$. where $\alpha,\beta$ are co-prime then the value of $\alpha+3\beta$ \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item A person forgets his 4-digit ATM pin code. But he remembers that in the code all the digits are different, the greatest digit is 7 and the sum of the first two digits is equal to the sum of the last two digits. Then the maximum number of trials necessary to obtain the correct code is \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item  If the line x = y = z intersects the line x$\sin{A} + y\sin{B} + z\sin{C}-18 = 0 = x\sin{2A}+ y\sin{2B}+z\sin{2C}-9$,
where A, B, C are the angles of a triangle ABC, then80$\brak{\sin{\frac{A}{2}}}\sin{\frac{B}{2}}\sin{\frac{C}{2}}$ \hfill{Apirl 2023}

\item $f\brak{x}=\int\frac{dx}{\brak{3+4x^2}\sqrt{4-3x^2}},\abs{x}<\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$. If $f\brak{0}=0$ and $f\brak{1}=\frac{1}{\alpha \beta}\tan^{-1}\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$ then $\alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}$ is equal to \hfill{Apirl 2023}
