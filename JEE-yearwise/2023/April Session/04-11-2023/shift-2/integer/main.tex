\item Let the tangent to the parabola $y^2 = 12x$ at the point $\brak{3,\alpha}$ be perpendicular to the line $2x+2y=3$. Then the square of distance of the point $\brak{6,-4}$ from the normal to the hyperbola $\alpha^2x^2 - 9y^2 = 9\alpha^2$ at its point $\brak{\alpha-1,\alpha+2}$ is equal to

\item Let the probability of getting head for a biased coin be $\frac{1}{4}$. It is tossed repeatedly until a head appears. Let N be the number of tosses required. If the probability that the equation $64x^2+5Nx+1=0$ has no real root is $\frac{p}{q}$, where p and q are co-prime, then $q-p$ is equal to
