 \item Let $Y = Y\brak{X}$
 be a curve lying in the first quadrant such that the area enclosed by the line $Y - y = Y^{\prime}\brak{X - x}$
 and the co-ordinate axes, where $\brak{x,y}$
 is any point on the curve, is always $ \frac{-y^2}{2Y^{\prime}\brak{x}} + 1, Y^{\prime}\brak{x} \ne 0$. If $Y\brak{1} = 1$, then $12Y\brak{2}$
 equals

 \item In an examination of Mathematics paper, there are 20 questions of equal marks and the question paper is divided into three sections : $A,B$
 and $C$
. A student is required to attempt total 15 questions taking at least 4 questions from each section. If section $A$
 has 8 questions, section $B$
 has 6 questions and section $C$
 has 6 questions, then the total number of ways a student can select 15 questions is
